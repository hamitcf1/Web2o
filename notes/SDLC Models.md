There are different ways to implement the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).** Each model has its own **advantages and use cases**.

---

## 1. Waterfall Model -- Linear & Step-by-Step
#### ðŸ”¹ How it Works?
- **Sequential approach**: Each phase (Planning -> Design -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance) must be **fully completed** before moving to the next.
- Changes are **difficult** to implement once a stage is completed.

#### ðŸ”¹ Best For:
- Well-defined projects with **fixed requirements
- Government & large enterprise projects
- Small projects with clear scope
#### ðŸ”¹ Pros:
- Simple & easy to manage
- Good for projects with **no changing requirements
- Clear documentation
#### ðŸ”¹ Cons:
- **Not flexible** - hard to make changes once a phase is completed
- Testing happens **late** in the process, increasing bug-fixing costs

## 2. Agile Model -- Iterative, Flexible & Fast

## 3. DevOps Model -- Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)

## 4. V-Model -- Testing Happens in Parallel with Development

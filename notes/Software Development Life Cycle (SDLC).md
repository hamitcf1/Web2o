SDLC is a structured process that defines the stages of **software development**, ensuring efficiency, quality, and cost-effectiveness. It consists of **six key stages:**


---

## 1. Planning 📝

#### 👉 What happens?
- Define the **project scope,** goals, and feasibility.
- Identify **risks, costs, and resource needs.**
- Stakeholders decide whether to proceed with the project.

#### 🔹 **Key Documents**
- Project Requirement Document (PRD)
- Feasibility Study
- Risk Assessment

---

## 2. Design

#### 👉 What happens?
- Architects and developers create the **technical blueprint** of the software.
- UI/UX designers define **user interface** and **user experience**.
- Database design and system architecture are planned.

#### 🔹**Types Of Design**
- **High-Level Design (HLD)** -- Overall system structure. 
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)** -- Detailed design of components, modules.

---

## 3. Development
#### 👉 What happens?
- Developers **write code** based on design documents.
- Code is written in programming languages like **Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, etc.** 
- Version control tools like **Git** are used for collaboration.

#### 🔹Best Practices:
- Use **coding standards** and **best practices**.
- Follow **Agile, Scrum,** or **Waterfall** methodologies.
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines** for smooth integration.

---

## 4. Testing
#### 👉 What happens?
- QA teams **test the software** to find and fix bugs.
- Functional, performance, security, and usability testing are conducted.
- Testers use **manual** and **automation testing tools** (Selenium, Cypress, JUnit, etc.).

#### 🔹[[Types of Testing]]:
- Unit Testing (Testing individual components)
- Integration Testing (Checking how modules interact)
- System Testing (Validating the entire application)
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Testing by end-users)

---

## 5. Deployment
#### 👉 What happens?
- The software is **released to production** for real users.
- **Beta testing** may be conducted before a full release.
- **DevOps** teams use tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins for deployment.

#### 🔹 Deployment Types:
- **Rolling Deployment** (Gradual release to users)
- **Blue-Green Deployment** (Switching between two environments)
- **Canary Release** (Testing with a small percentage of users first)

---

## 6. Maintenance
#### 👉 What happens?
- **Bug fixes, updates, and performance improvements** are done.
- Software is **monitored** for errors using **logging tools** (New Relic, Datadog).
- New features or patches are developed based on user feedback.

#### 🔹 Common Maintenance Types:
- **Corrective Maintenance** (Fixing Bugs)
- **Adaptive Maintenance** (Modifying for new environments)
- **Perfective Maintenance** (Enhancing performance & features)

## [[SDLC Models]]
There are different ways to implement SDLC:
- **Waterfall Model** - Linear, step-by-step approach.
- **Agile Model** - Iterative, flexible, and fast.
- **DevOps Model** - Continuous integration & delivery.
- **V-Model** - Testing happens in parallel with development.

Non-functional testing evaluates aspects of a software application that, while not related to specific behaviours or functions, are crucial for overall performance and user satisfaction. This form of testing focuses on attributes such as performance, usability, reliability, and security, ensuring that the application operates effectively under various conditions.

## Key Aspects of Non-Functional Testing
### 1. Definition & Purpose
- **Definition:** Non-functional testing assesses the non-functional requirements of a system--attributes that define how the system performs its functions, rather than the specific behaviors themselves. [^1]
- **Purpose:** The primary goal is to ensure that the software meets certain criteria regarding performance, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes, thereby enhancing user experience and satisfaction.

---

### 2. Types of Non-Functional Testing

- **Performance Testing:** Evaluates the system's responsiveness and stability under various workloads.
- **Load Testing:** Assesses the system's behavior under expected user loads to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Stress Testing:** Determines the system's stability under extreme conditions, such as high traffic or limited sources.
- **Usability Testing:** Examines the user interface and overall user experience to ensure the application is intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Security Testing:** identifies vulnerabilities to protect the system against threats and unauthorised access.
- **Compatibility Testing:** Ensures the software functions correctly across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.
- **Reliability Testing:** Measures the system's ability to function consistently over time without failures.
- **Scalability Testing:** Evaluates the system's capacity to sscale up or down in response to user demand.

---

### 3. Importance of Non-Functional Testing

- **Enhanced User Experience:** By focusing on performance and usability, non-functional testing ensures a seamless and satisfying user interaction.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identifies potential issues related to security and reliability, reducing the risk of system failures or breaches.
- **Compliance:** Ensures the software meets industry standards and regulatory requirements, which is crucial for legal and operational purposes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Helps in identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks, leading to a more efficient system.

---

### 4. Best Practices in Non-Functional Testing

- **Early Integration:** Incorporate non-functional testing early in the development lifecycle to identify and address issues promptly.
- **Clear Requirements:** Define measurable non-functional requirements to provide clear testing objectives.
- **Realistic Scenarios:** Simulate real-world conditions during testing to obtain accurate and relevant results.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement ongoing monitoring to detect and resolve issues that may arise in different environments or over time.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of testing procedures, findings, and resolutions to inform future development and testing efforts.
